# CalcJS
This is a README file for my calculator website project. I created this website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations using the buttons on the screen. You can view the website live at https://mashroofmashru.github.io/CalcJS/index.html

You will also need to clone this repository to your local directory using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mashroofmashru/CalcJS.git

Then, you can open the index.html file in your browser and see the website. Alternatively, you can use a live server extension for your code editor, such as VS Code Live Server, to launch the website automatically.


I hope you enjoy my website and find it useful. Thank you for visiting!
